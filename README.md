In this project, we utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze news headlines and predict whether the stock price will go up or down. We achieve this by applying various NLP preprocessing techniques, feature extraction methods, and machine learning models to classify the sentiment of the headlines as either positive (stock price will go up) or negative/neutral (stock price will go down or remain the same).
